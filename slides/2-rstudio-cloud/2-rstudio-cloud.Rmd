## What is RStudio Cloud?

<br>

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
.large[We created [**RStudio Cloud**](https://rstudio.cloud/) to make it easy for professionals, hobbyists, trainers, teachers, and students to do, share, teach, and learn data science using R.]
]

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-ide.png")
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud.png")
```

---

## Why RStudio Cloud?

- Does not require IT support
- Git works out of the box
- Knit to PDF and Word works out of the box

--
- Features designed for instructors:
  - Classes can be organized in workspaces
  - Members can be assigned different roles: instructor, TA, student
  - Projects can be public or private
  - Projects can be made into assignments 
  - Students can make copies of projects created by instructor
  - Instructor can peek into student projects
  - A base project template can ensure same packages in each new project created in the workspace

---

## Contexts

- Shorter workshops: Likely no opportunity to communicate pre-workshop instructions, varied computing background and learning goals

- Semester long courses
  - Intro data science / statistics: little to no background in stats, data science, programming
  - Upper level data science / statistics: Varied computing background and different computer setups

---

## RStudio Cloud: First look

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/landing-1.png")
```

---

## Workspaces

- When you create an account on RStudio Cloud you get a workspace of your own

- You can add a new workspace and control its permissions

- Projects in either workspace can be public or private

---

## A framework for workspaces

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/landing-2.png")
```

---

## Projects

.pull-left[
A new project in RStudio Cloud
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
is a new project in RStudio IDE
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-local.png")
```
]

.alert[
**PSA:** If you use RStudio, use projects! Trust me, you won’t regret it. Find out more on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
]

---

## Projects from Git

.pull-left[
A new project from Git repo in RStudio Cloud
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-git-cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
is the same as a new project from Git in RStudio IDE
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-git-local.png")
```
]

Both options `clone` a Git repo

---

## Sharing options

- Option 1: Share a single project

- Option 2: Invite users to a workspace (presumably with many projects)

.your-turn[

#### First you're the instructor:
- Create a new project and give it a name.
- Create a template R Markdown document in the project.
- Change the access level of the project so others can see it as well.
- Grab the project URL and share it with a group mate.

#### Now you're the student: 
Access your one of your group mates' project as if you're the student and they're the instructor.

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

---

## Pros / cons: Sharing a single project

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Students land directly in a project upon login
- Works well for workshops where all work will be completed in a single project
- Also great for sharing code in general, e.g. collaboration, reprexes, etc.
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students need to remember to make a copy of the project (which means you need to remember to remind them!)
- You can't keep track which students started their assignment
- Students control permissions
- You can't easily peek into student projects -- they would need to explicitly share the project with you

| moderator   | view, edit and manage all projects               | TA          |
| contributor | create, edit and manage their own projects       | student     |

- After initial round of enrolment (e.g. drop/add) switch over to this access level
- Use invitations for visitors added mid-semester

.your-turn[

#### You’re the instructor:

- Create a new workspace, give it a name, and add a short description.
  - Tip: Check in with your group mates and use a different name.
- Change the settings of your workspace to Shared.
- Change the permissions of your workspace how you like.
- Grab the sharing link for your workspace, and share with a group mate.

#### Now you’re the student:
- Join one of your group mates’ workspace.

## Base projects

One of the most attractive features of RStudio Cloud!

- Packages you want *installed* on all student projects

--
- Text documents you want to appear on **all** student projects (e.g. code of conduct, turn-in instructions, etc.)

--
- Applies to all projects created **after** base project has been specified, doesn't apply retroactively

--
- Can be updated as many times as you like throughout the course (without having to convince your IT!!!)

---

## Setting up your base project

.right[ .large[ `r emo::ji("woman_teacher")`  ]  ]

---

<!--

.your-turn[

#### You’re the instructor:
- Add a base project to **YOUR** workspace:
  - Install one or two of your favourite packages.
  - Start an R Markdown document so necessary packages get installed.
  - Add a code-of-conduct.md or some other plain text document.
  - Make this project visible to everyone.
  - In the settings menu, set this project as the base project.
- Create a new assignment: `Homework 01`.

#### Now you’re the student:
- Go back to your group mates' workspace and start the assignment.

## Git integration

`r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Only relevant if teaching with Git & GitHub!

--

`r emo::ji("grin")` Base project template can be used, so new project from Git also has the right packages installed!

--

`r emo::ji("disappointed")` Need to introduce yourself to Git **once for each project**. Start each assignment with one of the following:
.small[
- In the *Terminal*:
```
git config user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config user.email "mona.lise@example.com"
```
- In the R *Console*:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Mona Lisa", user.email = "mona.lise@example.com")
```
]

---

## Pros / cons: Sharing a workspace

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Various permission levels
- Base projects with desired packages installed
- Assignments -- no more "make a copy of the project before starting work"
- Peek into students’ projects
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/view-derived-projects.png")
```
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students land in the workspace, may need to provide instructions for the next steps
- Git config for each project can get tedious and doesn't reflect realistic practice
]

---

## Common pitfalls

- Changes you make after student launches a project under either model (single project or workspace) won’t propagate to their project


--
- Packages in the base project will be **installed** in all projects in the workspace, but not **loaded**
  - If you need students to run code in the Console that requires a package, your instructions should remind them to load the package first
  - If using Rmd document, add a `load-package` chunk on top

## `r emo::ji("parcel")` rscloud

- A new package for managing RStudio Cloud spaces with R: [github.com/rstudio/rscloud](https://github.com/rstudio/rscloud)
- Requires an API key, which any instructor can request (via email for now, but soon in the UI as well)

# Parting remarks

---

## Tips

- Each project is allocated 1GB of RAM
  - Test things out before assignments involving large datasets 

- What your students see is not always what you see
  - Create a secondary account and add as a student

---

## More tips

- Make brief screencasts for getting students oriented with the platform (especially if remote teaching), or use mine!
