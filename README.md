### Instructor

[Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](http://mine-cr.com/) is Professional Educator
and Data Scientist at RStudio as well as Senior Lecturer in the School
of Mathematics at University of Edinburgh. Mine’s work focuses on
innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on
computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and
open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing
retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM. Mine works
on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum,
using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and
complex datasets. Mine works on the OpenIntro project, whose mission is
to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower
barriers to education. As part of this project she co-authored three
open-source introductory statistics textbooks. She is also the creator
and maintainer of [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org/) and
she teaches the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera. In 2018 Mine
received the David Pickard Teaching Award and in 2016 the ASA Waller
Education Award. She is also the recipient of the 2015 JSM Best Paper
Award in the Section on Teaching Statistics in the Health Sciences and
the 2014 Duke University David and Janet Vaughan Brooks Award for
Teaching Excellence.
